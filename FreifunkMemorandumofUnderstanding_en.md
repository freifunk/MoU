# Freifunk Memorandum of Understanding

After 10 years of a growing Freifunk collective, several ideas, concepts and expectations have emerged in many independent communities, some of them apparently unconciliable.

With this Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) we would like to commit to a common, unifying view on Freifunk shared by all communities. This document is to serve as a basis for all communities to discuss and reflect on the following points:
* Why do we engage in Freifunk?
* Which are the ideals behind it?
* Which goals do we pursue?
* What principles guide us in our decisions and actions?

The goal of this text is to develop an understanding which connects all individuals and group who act under the label Freifunk. Despite the independence of the different communities, we think it is reasonable and important to come to a common understanding on the basic principles of Freifunk, in order to act jointly and support each other in our activities.

## Preamble - What is a Free Network?

A free network is a computer network that allows free local transit. In other words, information flowing inside the network does not suffer interference by censorship, prioritization or any other actions, except those required to transport the traffic from the source to its destination. A free network is defined by what its users can do with it, rather than the particular technology it is built on.

## Freifunk as a movement of do-it-yourself wireless free networks

The goal of Freifunk is, in a nutshell, to enable local communities to build and operate free wireless networks.

Freifunk allows users of a network to be simultaneously its operators: they run wireless devices that self-organize into a communication network, thus connecting buildings, streets, districts or even entire villages and cities.

This means that a Freifunk network is built in a decentralized way and is operated by many individuals. This decentralized structure of organization deliberately promotes local activities instead of depending on a higher entity.

In addition to the ideals of free networks, Freifunk networks also aim at being:
 
 1. Open and public:
  * everybody can operate a node and thereby extend the network
  * everyone can use the network and its services
 2. Anonymously accessible:
  * neither users nor operators have to register in order to participate
  * this does not mean that Freifunk networks anonymize traffic. Users are responsible for end-to-end encryption and anonymizing their traffic if they so wish.
 3. Decentralized:
  * no user or group of users can control other users' devices, and thus another part of the network
  * however, operators have the choice to allow remote maintenance
  * interventions on the nodes, for example firmware upgrades or other remote administration work, must be done with explicit agreement of the respective operators
 4. Operated in a non-commercial way
  * usage of the network is free of charge
  * <insert your other views here - I was not at the discussion on commercial issues, so feel free to complete this point>
 5. Privacy-preserving:
  * we log neither connection nor inventory data
  * we do not save personally identifiable data except the one explicitly provided by operators to facilitate network maintenance, such as contact information and geographical coordinates

It follows that a Freifunk network ends where the Internet or any private network (e.g. a home network) begins. Traffic entering such networks is not Freifunk traffic. Node operators can, however decide whether they would like to provide internet access, be it for the participants of the mesh network or for the public. When doing so, it is important that Freifunk should not be perceived as a "provider of free-of-charge internet access".

### Goals of Freifunk

The daily use of communication networks has become fundamental to every area of our society. Nevertheless, the large majority of the population is not aware of the details of network operation and, in consequence, cannot critically assess the impact of the widespread usage of such networks, in particular of the Internet and cellular networks.

Freifunk has declared their goals to be:
* to promote the understanding of networks and network technology ("Network/Code Literacy") as well as their impact on society, by all sectors of the population,
* to encourage the population at large to actively engage in the research, design and creation of free (wireless) networks in a "do it yourself" fashion
* to make all our technical knowledge and implementations publicly available and allow others to build on it
* and to take political action in order to achieve and protect the legal support necessary to run free networks.

### Principles of Freifunk

Creation of "do it yourself" networks is a process. We are aware that we may not fully attain every goal in this process. Therefore we should regularly reflect critically and discuss our approaches. To us, learning and improvement of social and technological structures are of utmost importance.

We are committed to promoting a respectful, inclusive environment - necessary for learning and collaborating - and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We consider diversity of ideas to be an important foundation to reach our goals. Anyone willing to support the Freifunk movement is welcome to join us, independently of their social and technical background, provided they also follow our principles of inclusiveness and non-discrimination.

We would like to avoid hierarchies, in particular knowledge hierarchies, caused by the desire of participants to merely consume the services of communication networks. According to our view, this leads to the erosion of the basic idea of a "do it yourself" network. Therefore we encourage and support every interested entity in getting familiarized with the ideas and technical aspects of Freifunk, even thought we are aware this can be an elaborate learning process. To facilitate this, all our knowledge and software is to be released to the public without restrictions. We aim at providing very good documentation that enables anyone to extend our systems or suggest improvements, under the motto that openness creates confidence.

Politically, the Freifunk movement is non-partisan and works across party lines.

### Forms of organization

A Freifunk community is a loose affiliation of several individuals. Local associations may support the community when such a registered legal entity is beneficial, e.g., for collecting donations or signing contracts; however, founding your own association is no precondition for Freifunk. Participation in a local community cannot be restricted to members of any association or supporting organisation.

For the few community-overlapping decisions we established a "Freifunk Advisory Council", a representation of community members of the different German federal states. This council can be called in when there are conflicts between communities.
